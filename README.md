## 📘 Why MetaOmics-ML?  

Metagenomics can revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities. However, **high-dimensional data** and **complex biological patterns** often require **advanced computational approaches**.  

🔹 Traditional bioinformatics pipelines can process and classify reads.  
🔹 Machine learning can detect hidden patterns and classify disease states and generate actionable insights.  

**MetaOmics-ML bridges this gap** by offering workflows that combine both worlds.
