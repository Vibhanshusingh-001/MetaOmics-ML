# Kraken 2: A Taxonomic Sequence Classification Tool

## Overview
**Kraken 2** is a **highly accurate and ultrafast taxonomic classifier** for metagenomic sequence data. It assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences (reads) by examining **k-mers** within the sequences and mapping them to a **database of known genomes**.  
It is widely used in **metagenomics**, **microbiome studies**, and **pathogen detection**.

## Key Features

- **Speed & Efficiency** 
- **Exact Alignment of k-mers**
- **Low Memory Requirement**
- **Custom Database Support**
- **Classification at Multiple Taxonomic Levels**

---

## How Kraken 2 Works

1. **Database Construction**  
   - Builds a reference database from known genomes.  
   - Compresses k-mers into a more memory-efficient format.  

2. **Sequence Classification**  
   - Reads are split into k-mers.  
   - Each k-mer is searched in the database.  
   - Kraken assigns the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of all matched taxa to the read.  

3. **Output**  
   - Produces a classification report showing taxonomic breakdown of reads.  
   - Can be used with **Bracken** (a companion tool) for more accurate abundance estimation.

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Download or Build Database

## Command 1: Downloading a Reference Library
```bash
kraken2-build --download-library bacteria --db kraken2_db
````

### Breakdown:

* **kraken2-build** : Utility used to build or manage Kraken 2 databases.
* **--download-library bacteria** : Downloads the reference genome library for *bacteria* from NCBI RefSeq.
* **--db kraken2\_db** : Specifies the name/location of the database directory (`kraken2_db`) where the library files will be stored.

---

## Command 2: Building the Database

```bash
kraken2-build --build --db kraken2_db
```

### Breakdown:

* **kraken2-build** : The same utility for database handling.
* **--build** : Processes the downloaded reference sequences to construct the Kraken 2 database.
* **--db kraken2\_db** : Tells Kraken 2 which database directory to use (`kraken2_db`).

 This command builds the actual **searchable classification database** from the downloaded bacterial genomes.

## Command 3: Running the command 

## Command
```bash
kraken2 --db kraken2_db_uhgg_v2.0.2 --threads 32 \
        --report kraken2_output/ERR14218891.k2report \
        --classified-out kraken2_output/ERR14218891_classified.fastq \
        --unclassified-out kraken2_output/ERR14218891_unclassified.fastq \
        --output kraken2_output/ERR14218891.kraken2.out \
        bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.1.gz \
        bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.2.gz

```
