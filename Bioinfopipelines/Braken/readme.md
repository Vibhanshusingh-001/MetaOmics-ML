# Bracken Tool

## Overview
**Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with Kraken)** is a statistical tool designed to improve species- and genus-level abundance estimates from **Kraken2** classification outputs.  

Kraken classifies reads using exact k-mer matches, but it often assigns reads to higher taxonomic ranks ( genus or family) if multiple species share similar k-mers. Bracken refines these results by **redistributing reads from higher taxonomic levels down to species or genus levels**, providing a more accurate abundance estimation.

## Key Features
- Works on top of **Kraken2 outputs**.
- Provides more accurate **relative abundance** of species/genus.
- Uses **Bayesian inference** to re-estimate abundances.
- Handles cases where reads are ambiguously classified by Kraken.

---

## Workflow
1. **Input**:
   - Kraken2 classification report (`.kreport` file).
   - Bracken database built from the same Kraken database.
   
2. **Processing**:
   - Reads assigned to higher taxonomic ranks are probabilistically redistributed to lower taxonomic ranks using precomputed k-mer distributions.
   
3. **Output**:
   - Abundance estimates of taxa at a user-specified level (species, genus, etc.).
   - Results in a tab-delimited text file.

## Example Command

```bash
bracken -d kraken_database \
        -i kraken2_output/ERR14218891.k2report \
        -o bracken_output/ERR14218891.bracken.out \
        -r 100 -l S -t 10
```

## Breakdown of Options

| **Option** | **Parameter**                            | **Description**                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`       | `kraken_database`                        | Path to the **Kraken2 database** used during classification. Bracken requires the same database.           |
| `-i`       | `kraken2_output/ERR14218891.k2report`    | Input file: Kraken2 report (`.kreport`) containing taxonomic classification results.                       |
| `-o`       | `bracken_output/ERR14218891.bracken.out` | Output file where Bracken’s re-estimated abundances will be saved.                                         |
| `-r`       | `100`                                    | Read length (in base pairs). Needed for Bracken’s statistical model to redistribute reads.                 |
| `-l`       | `S`                                      | Taxonomic level for abundance estimation: `S = Species`. (Other options: `G = Genus`, `F = Family`, etc.). |
| `-t`       | `10`                                     | Threshold: Minimum number of reads required to report a taxon. Taxa with fewer reads are excluded.         |

## Summary

This Bracken command takes the Kraken2 classification report (`ERR14218891.k2report`) and refines it to estimate **species-level abundances** (`-l S`), assuming **100 bp read length** (`-r 100`).
It will only include taxa supported by at least **10 reads** (`-t 10`), and the results will be saved in:
