# Fastp Quality Control Report

This document provides a quality control summary generated by **fastp (v0.23.2)** for the dataset **ERR14218664**. The sequencing data are paired-end reads (101 cycles each).

---

## General Summary
- **fastp version:** 0.23.2  
- **Sequencing type:** Paired-end (101 cycles + 101 cycles)  
- **Mean read length (before filtering):** 100 bp, 100 bp  
- **Mean read length (after filtering):** 100 bp, 100 bp  
- **Duplication rate:** 0.29%  
- **Insert size peak:** 169 bp  

This indicates that the sequencing run generated consistent, high-quality paired-end reads with minimal duplication.

---

## Before Filtering
- **Total reads:** 2.16 M  
- **Total bases:** 217.6 Mbp  
- **Q20 bases:** 213.07 M (97.9%)  
- **Q30 bases:** 197.7 M (90.9%)  
- **GC content:** 49.7%  

High percentages of Q20 and Q30 bases indicate reliable sequencing quality.

---

## After Filtering
- **Total reads:** 2.08 M  
- **Total bases:** 209.1 Mbp  
- **Q20 bases:** 206.4 M (98.7%)  
- **Q30 bases:** 193.6 M (92.6%)  
- **GC content:** 49.6%  

After filtering, the overall sequence quality improved slightly (higher Q20/Q30 proportions), showing that trimming removed low-quality bases while retaining most reads.

---

## Filtering Results
- **Reads passed filters:** 2.08 M (96.1%)  
- **Reads with low quality:** 85.0 K (3.93%)  
- **Reads with too many Ns:** 0  
- **Reads too short:** 42  

Only a small fraction of reads were discarded, confirming that the dataset is clean and suitable for downstream analysis.

## Adapter Content
Adapters or bad ligation sequences were present in very low percentages (~0.007â€“0.008%). This suggests that adapter trimming was already applied during preprocessing.

### Read 1 Adapters
- Common adapter fragments detected include `C`, `CT`, `CTG`, and `CTGT`.  

### Read 2 Adapters
- Similar low-level adapter sequences were detected.

## Insert Size Estimation
The insert size distribution shows a peak around **169 bp**. Approximately **91.2% of read pairs** did not overlap, which is expected for paired-end libraries with this insert size.

## Conclusion
The sequencing data show **excellent quality**, with very high Q30 scores, low duplication, minimal adapter contamination, and balanced GC content (~49.6%). After filtering, more than **96% of reads** were retained, making this dataset suitable for downstream analysis.
