# 📥 SRA RunSelector – NCBI Data Retrieval Tool

## 🔎 What is SRA RunSelector?
**SRA RunSelector** is a powerful web-based tool provided by the **NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)** that allows researchers to **search, filter, and download metadata** and sequencing run information from publicly available studies.  

It serves as the **first step** in any bioinformatics pipeline when working with NCBI-hosted next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Search by SRA Project Accession (SRP), BioProject (PRJNA), or Experiment**  
  Input the study accession ID to retrieve all sequencing runs associated with it.  

- **Filter Samples by Metadata**  
  - Organism  
  - Library type (RNA-seq, WGS, Metagenome, etc.)  
  - Sequencing platform (Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore)  
  - Layout (Single-end / Paired-end)  
  - Study condition (disease/control, tissue type, etc.)  

- **Download Metadata Tables**  
  Export a **customized CSV/TSV file** containing all relevant run information (SRR IDs, experiment type, sequencing length, etc.).  

- **Batch Data Access**  
  Prepare a list of **SRA Run IDs (SRR)** for bulk download using `prefetch`, `fasterq-dump`, or other SRA Toolkit commands.
  ```
  Use **fastq-dump** only if you have very limited storage or a small dataset.

  Use **fasterq-dump** for speed and efficiency, especially in metagenomics or cancer genomics projects where datasets are huge.


The **SRA RunSelector** is the gateway to efficiently **query, filter, and retrieve sequencing datasets** from NCBI’s SRA, making it an essential tool for **metagenomics, transcriptomics, and cancer genomics research**.
