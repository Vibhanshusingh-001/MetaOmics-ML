# Bowtie2: A Fast and Sensitive Read Alignment Tool

## Introduction
**Bowtie2** is a widely used open-source software tool designed for aligning sequencing reads to long reference genomes. It is optimized for speed and memory efficiency, making it ideal for high-throughput sequencing data such as those generated by Illumina platforms.

---

## Key Features
- **Fast and memory-efficient**: Uses a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and FM-index for efficient alignment.
- **Supports paired-end and single-end reads.**
- **Handles mismatches, indels, and gaps.**
- **Local and global alignment modes.**
- **Multithreading support** for faster processing.
- Outputs in **SAM format** (compatible with SAMtools).

---

## Workflow
1. **Indexing the Reference Genome**  
   Before aligning, Bowtie2 builds an index of the reference genome:
   ```bash
   bowtie2-build reference.fasta reference_index
2. **command to run bowtie2**
   ```bash
   bowtie2 -x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as \
        -1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz \
        -2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
        --un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz \
        -S /dev/null -p 16
    ```
   # Explanation of Bowtie2 Command

The following table explains each option used in the Bowtie2 command:

| **Option / Argument** | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| `bowtie2` | The main program used for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome. |
| `-x GRCh38_noalt_as/GRCh38_noalt_as` | Specifies the path and basename of the Bowtie2 index files for the reference genome (here, GRCh38 without alternative contigs). |
| `-1 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz` | Input file containing **paired-end forward reads** (R1) after quality control and trimming with `fastp`. |
| `-2 fastp_output/ERR14218891_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz` | Input file containing **paired-end reverse reads** (R2) after quality control and trimming with `fastp`. |
| `--un-conc-gz bowtie2_output/ERR14218891_nonhuman.fastq.gz` | Writes pairs of reads that **do not align** to the reference genome into compressed FASTQ files. Output files will have suffixes `.1` and `.2` appended (e.g., `ERR14218891_nonhuman.1.fastq.gz` and `ERR14218891_nonhuman.2.fastq.gz`). |
| `-S /dev/null` | Directs the alignment output (SAM file) to `/dev/null`, effectively discarding it. This is useful when you only care about the **unaligned reads** and not the alignment itself. |
| `-p 16` | Runs Bowtie2 using **16 CPU threads** in parallel, speeding up the alignment process. |

## Summary
This command aligns paired-end reads (`R1` and `R2`) to the human reference genome (**GRCh38_noalt_as**). Instead of keeping the aligned reads, it discards them (`-S /dev/null`) and saves only the **unaligned read pairs** in compressed FASTQ format.
